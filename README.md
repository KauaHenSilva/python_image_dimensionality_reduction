# Image Dimensionality Reduction

This project demonstrates how to perform dimensionality reduction on images using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used is the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow 2.16.1
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow==2.16.1 numpy matplotlib
```

## Notebook Overview

1. **Imports**: Import necessary libraries.
2. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load the MNIST dataset and preprocess it.
3. **Build and Train the Model**: Build and train an autoencoder model.
4. **Visualize the Results**: Visualize the original, encoded, and reconstructed images.

## Usage

To run the notebook, execute the cells in the provided order. The notebook will guide you through the process of dimensionality reduction using an autoencoder.

## Results

The notebook will display the original, encoded, and reconstructed images to show the effectiveness of the dimensionality reduction process.
